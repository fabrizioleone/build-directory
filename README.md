# Build Directory

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Fab993/build_directory)

*build_directory* is a Python script that helps you to keep your code tidy and reproducible. It is strongly recommended to pair it with a version control system (e.g. GitHub).

### Usage

Download this repo on your computer and save the file build_directory.py in your favourite directory. Create a new Python script, call it for example "trial.py", and type the following:

```python
n      = 3                                 # Number of taks you want to initialize
draft  = True                              # Set to False if you don't want a folder for your draft
slides = True                              # Set to False if you don't want a folder for your slides 
d      = build_directory('YOURDIRECTORY')  # 'YOURDIRECTORY' is where your project will be created
d.create_dir(n,draft,slides)               # Create a project with n tasks
```
Run trial.py to in your favourite Python compiler (e.g. VS code, PyCharm, Jupyter,...). It will create a folder called "Project" located at 'YOURDIRECTORY'. The folder has the following structure 

```sh
.
├── draft
├── execute
│   └── execute_all.py
├── slides
└── tasks
    ├── task1
    │   ├── code
    │   │   └── Main.py
    │   ├── input
    │   └── output
    ├── task2
    │   ├── code
    │   │   └── Main.py
    │   ├── input
    │   └── output
    └── task3
        ├── code
        │   └── Main.py
        ├── input
        └── output
```
The code is divided into tasks (here, three tasks). Each task is made of input, code and output. The output of each task is the input of the following one. I have mutuated this structure from [Dingel's Project Template](https://github.com/jdingel/projecttemplate). The script above automatically initializes an executable file called "Main.py" under the code folder of each task. The file "./execute/execute_all.py" runs the "Main.py" files of each task sequentially. Launch it to run your code altogether and reproduce the final result. 

**NOTE**: if you increase the number of tasks after running the script above, you also need to update "execute_all.py" accordingly.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great! I maintain *build_directory* on GitHub at this [repo](https://github.com/Fab993/build_directory). Pull requests are more than welcome.
